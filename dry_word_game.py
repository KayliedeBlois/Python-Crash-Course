Hi Mom, 

Just writing to tell you that I've quit my job as a OCCUPATION and I'm moving to
COUNTRY. The truth is, I've always been passionate about PLURAL_NOUN, and COUNTRY
is the best place in the world to build a career around them. I'll need to start 
small-- At first, all I'll be allowed to do is VERB near them, but when people 
see how ADJECTIVE I can be, I'm sure to rise to the top.

Don't worry about me, and tell dad to take good care of my PERSONAL_ITEM. I'll be
sure to call every HOLIDAY.

Love, 

NAME
